**Demo Paper Outline**

#Introduction
-importance of occupancy detection for saving energy
  -no need for occupants to directly interact with environment
  -only turn on lights/heat when people are there
  -they don't need to inform system directly, so more likely
   that it'll work
-previous work
  -focused on accuracy, specialized hardware, lots of training
  -localization only needs to have >= the granularity that we can control
    -in practice, this works out to having to localize within 10-20% of the total floor area
  -cheap, ubiquitously available, easily configurable hardware
    -no training required, just minor setup
