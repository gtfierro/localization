**Demo Paper Outline**

#Introduction
-importance of occupancy detection for saving energy
  -no need for occupants to directly interact with environment
  -only turn on lights/heat when people are there
  -they don't need to inform system directly, so more likely
   that it'll work
-previous work
  -focused on accuracy, specialized hardware, lots of training
  -localization only needs to have >= the granularity that we can control
    -in practice, this works out to having to localize within 10-20% of the total floor area
  -cheap, ubiquitously available, easily configurable hardware
    -no training required, just minor setup

#Explanation
-Hardware infrasctructure
  -small number of routers, 1 per 'actuation zone'
    -running OpenWrt, easy to install, free
  -required granularity is lessened by the fact we only have to worry about
   localization in one direction (differs per floor plan, but rectangular model is great)
  -running cross-compiled tcpdump with a couple minor modifications
-Software
  -central server to do all the bulky processing
    -don't fill up kernel buffer on routers (64MB RAM, best case)
    -talk through tcpdump flags 
  -centroids
    -k-nearest points
    -conversion of dBM to linear scale
-Actuation, Energy Savings,
  -register the mac addresses of devices
  -up to direct actuation of the lights.
    -define threshold T of people in room
    -more than T people in zone, lights full on
    -less than T, more than0, lights half
    -no people, turn off
  -run tests with different sample times, look at accuracy
