\section{Demonstration}
We plan to demonstrate an example of deploying our occupancy detection infrastructure on an ad-hoc ``corporate network'' consisting of a few routers. Arbitrary users will be able to associate with the network using either a personal device or a provided wifi-enabled smartphone, simulating a user entering a campus building or corporate office. Once associated with the network, a set of routers in \emph{monitor} mode running the infrastructure and connected to a central computer will be able to track RSSIs for each device and provide occupancy counts for each of a small number of predefined zones; the counts will be displayed on a screen in real-time. Then, using a set of wireless motes, we will actuate lamps based on the occupancy counts for each area as an example application of the occupancy infrastructure.
