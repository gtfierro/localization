Detecting building occupancy has far-reaching implications for building control, from scaling the power usage of the building's individual systems to allowing occupants to control their environment.  Existing systems use a network of specialized sensors, like motion sensors, cameras or RFID tags, that require deploying new hardware and in some cases occupant participation. We demonstrate that it is possible to leverage existing network infrastructure and the ubiquity of smartphones to count occupants at HVAC zone-level granularity with no actions required from the occupants. This allows us to control lighting and HVAC systems, for example, turning down air condition in sparsely populated areas, providing ventilation for precisely the number of people in each space, and turning on/off lighting automatically.
