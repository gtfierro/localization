Detecting building occupancy has far-reaching implications for building control, from scaling the power usage of the building's individual systems to allowing occupants to control their environment.  Existing systems use a network of specialized sensors, like motion sensors or RFID tags, to gather a limited amount of relevant data. This makes deploying such systems troublesome as well as not achieving the goal of collecting enough data to reliably actuate the building's systems.  We demonstrate that it is possible to leverage existing network infrastructure and the ubiquity of smartphones to get a broader set of data about how many occupants are in the building and where they are situated. This allows us to control lighting and ventilation systems, for example, keeping them active only in areas where occupants are situated.
