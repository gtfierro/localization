\f0\fs34 \cf0 Our demo will require setting up 5 wireless access points placed throughout the demo area. The access points will be placed in passive monitoring mode and do not need to be connected to the Internet. One of the access points will broadcast a demonstration network to which attendees can connect to participate in the demo.\
\
We will divide the space into 4 virtual zones and place a small desk lamp in each zone. Attendees will walk around with either their own smartphone or one we provide associated with our network. As attendees walk through the space our system will track their location and update occupancy counts in each of the 4 virtual zones. If the occupancy count in a zone goes to zero the lights in that area will be turned off.}
