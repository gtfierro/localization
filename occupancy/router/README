### README ###
To set up a computer to run the localization piece, do the following


1. Run the redis server with the default settings
    
    redis-server


2. Run the flask web-server to see Anthony's pretty interface (and to see where everything is)

    (from localization/mapdemo)

    python app.py

3. Prepare your configuration file for your network. This is a text file containing two types of entries.
    
    bssid <mac-address>   #identifies the BSSID for one of the routers on your network. This assists in filtering
        -- or --
    router <mac-address> <ip-address> <x-coord> <y-coord> #mac address, ip address and x-coord,y-coord for a router
                                                          #with relation to the floor map

4. Run the localization script!

    python geo.py <path-to-configuration-file>


5. Start adding client mac addresses via some redis client (details coming soon), or by waiting for Andrew's arp-thing
   to take care of this automagically


6. Visit localhost:8000 to see where everything is
