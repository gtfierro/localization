**What is the goal?

-the goal of this experiment is to try to use the placement of access points along with
andrew's matplotlib script to try and map out the path of someone as they walk around the room.

**What to do

1. make sure we can get all of the access points to report back to the main computer. Determine some 
  way of storing all of the (RSSI,time) data for each router on the computer so (a) the routers don't 
  fill up, and (b) we can access it later

2. decide on placement of the routers. We have 4, so maybe 1 in each of zones 2-5? Try to place them
  in the middle rather than near the edges.

3. configure the routers to listen to the test computer's MAC

4. have stop watch running on test computer, walk around at a CONSTANT pace. If we can have GPS tracking on the floor
  to tell where we actually are, that'd be great too. We need to be able to, for any given timeseries point, tell 
  *where* we were at the floor at *what* time and *what* the RSSI values for each of the routers were.

5. sync up the timeseries data
